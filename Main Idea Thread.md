# Triad-Wars-Community-Collaboration
Ideas I have seen requested many times! Helping out the devs with the sorting! - Sonny
Special Thanks to BridgetKFisher for making this possible :) Also a big thanks to Handsome-Jack and CrowntTheJules for some
of the ideas here below!


First and foremost I have no legal claims and am not interested in claiming any of the ideas I put here, they are merely
suggestions that I have seen that the community thinks would make the game better. The staff of Triad Wars has my permission
to use these ideas.


Priotity System: I will class ideas from a (1) to a (5). 1 being detrimental to the game's success or very highly requested
by the community, 5 being very low in priority, but a nice addition further along the games lifespan.


Updates and new ideas: New ideas Will briefly mentioned here, and confirmation or cancellation of a suggestion (current
version 1.0)


- **THREAD STARTS HERE!**

- Character Customization and Loadout:

 1. (2)[Confirmed] Female Character ->
This has been requested multiple times by the Community as it will
allow the female playerbase to play as their gender, expanding the story possibilities into the Triad Wars Universe. Although
this is confirmed, A lot of work must be done first, such as voice actors, new animations, playermodel etc. "already on our
list of things to do" - Dev team.

 2. (2-3)[No information so far] Character Modification ->
Allowing the playerbase to further modify their TW character's body and face. Height, weight, muscle definition, facial hair,
eyebrow style, scars, eyes, ears etc. This is incredibly important to the game, as it allows players to make their own
characer, unique to every other player in the world. A Unique character will stand out, allow potential roleplay or storyline
to be built and keep players interested in the game. Although some aspects of this should be monetized, such as hairstyles
and tattoos (leaving very few as starters), the majority of the body customization and facial customization should be free.
No answer to this request as of yet.
 
 3. (4)[Semi-Confirmed] Fighting Styles and Skills ->
New fighting styles to choose from (muay thai, judo, wrestling etc), skill trees for moves and with that, different
animations for counters, grapples and throws. A nice addition to the world of TW, keeping things fresh, however not essintial
for the the core gameplay. Choosing a fighting style (2-3) at the start of the game (including the one in action at the
moment) would be nice, a nod towards saints row 2. However I would not rule out only one fighting style, when you could
utilize the skill tree to unluck certain moves within different styles (mixed martial arts). For example, you could judo
throw someone to take down and focus on arm bars and locks to cripple enemies, but use a standing fight stance of a muay thai
fighter. This also might be useful with customizating your gang members fighting style. The devs have confirmed that there
will be skill trees for different moves, however no word on different fighting
styles in its entirety yet. If you count the fighting styles already in the game a mix of karate, wing chun and jujitsu would
be included If I am not wrong.

- Vehicles and Customization:
- Weapons and Customization:
- Balances, Tuning and/or Reworks:

 1. (1)[Unconfirmed] Fine tuning of driving and running ->
Running, which seems to be a lot better with the controller (understandably), can be quite frustrating on the keyboard. One
of the major issues is the autoclimb/vault, which can run you into walls, places you don't want to go, and even get you
stuck, making it hell in small areas. It does not seem to autoclimb on the xbox controller, but with the keyboard it will
automatically do it, if this is intentional or not I am unsure. The driving, which is much smoother than the walking, still
has some issues, feeling a lot less smooth than the original sleeping dogs for some reason. Making it more reactive to input
and slightly upping the horizontal handling on all vehicles should fix this. 

 2. (2)[Unconfirmed] XP Modifiers ->
Different kills, whether it is with a vehicle, gun, melee, a type of kill, environment, headshot etc, there should be modifiers to the default 25XP.

- Safehouse and Customization:
- Racket Tech Tree:
- Turf and Turf Manager:
- External Applications and Websites/Forums:
 1. (2)
- Chat and Social hub:

 1. (5)[Unconfirmed] Ability to take selfies ->
A very non-essential yet fun and immersive feature that could be implemented into the TW world. Just raided someones base?
Take a selfie of yourself smiling over their dead goons and send the picture straight to them!. This could also be used with
a small caption, popping up on the right tab of your personal page whenever a friend posts a selfie. New outfits, cars,
houses etc can all be shown off.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Messages to friends look like texts ->
Also non-essential, yet an immersive feature that could be added to the game to make it seem like you are actually part of
the world. Perhaps even an animation of your character bringing up their phone when you open your messages would be a nice
little feature.

 3. (3)[Unconfirmed] Letting you message in a raid/Or showing friend status (IN RAID) ->
With all buttons locked whenever you are in combat or raiding, you are unable to properly read and respond to messages. I
don't see why not, however your message menu should not pause the game, giving you an unfair advantage mid raid. If this
cannot be done, a status next to your friends name letting you know their in a raid would be nice.

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Creation Kit ->
A kit created by the devs that contains simple -> intricate pattners, lines and color selection etc, that will allow players
to create their own clothing, (on top of a plain existing model of clothing of course, like v-necks) tattoos, shoes,
accesories (custom mask etc), decals for cars, emblems for gang. This will allow players to have one of a kind patterns that
no one else has, giving each player the opportunity to feel unique and make a name for themselves. I am sure the community
would be fine with the devs selling this kit as a pack, as long as it is a reasonable price $10-$20. If you need reference
material, APB reloaded's pattern maker is a good comparison.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Community Made Items ->
Simply put, Items you can find now in the vehicles tab and clothing, hair, weapons etc, some of these will be made by the
community. Rather than having thousands of items pouring in, the community will make a pol, voting their favourite 5-10 items
of the week/month/whatever period of time via screenshots on the forum, and they will added to the game. To prevent legal
issues, they will either only be available by in game cash (not gold), with official TW items being sold in gold, or TW devs
will take a 50% tax (or whatever is agreed) from the item (100 gold hair, 50 goes back to devs, 50 to player). There are many
examples of this model being extremely profitable and encouraging creativity in the community, as seen in CS:GO where
majority of the guns you buy in cases, are community made, or SecondLife, where 99% of the content is community made.
