# Triad-Wars-Community-Collaboration
Ideas I have seen requested many times! Helping out the devs with the sorting! - Sonny
Special Thanks to BridgetKFisher for making this possible :) Also a big thanks to Handsome-Jack, Funkeemonkee and
CrowntTheJules for some of the ideas here below! Keep in mind many of these suggestions will not be added in (if they even
are) for a long time.


First and foremost I have no legal claims and am not interested in claiming any of the ideas I put here, they are merely
suggestions that I have seen that the community thinks would make the game better. The staff of Triad Wars has my permission
to use these ideas.


**Priotity System:** I will class ideas from a (1) to a (5). 1 being detrimental to the game's success or very highly
requested by the community, 5 being very low in priority, but a nice addition further along the games lifespan.

- **THREAD STARTS HERE!**


- *Character, Customization and Loadout:*
-

 1. (2)[Confirmed] Female Character ->
This has been requested multiple times by the Community as it will
allow the playerbase to play as a female, expanding the story possibilities into the Triad Wars Universe. Although
this is confirmed, A lot of work must be done first, such as voice actors, new animations, playermodel etc. "already on our
list of things to do" - Dev team.

 2. (2-3)[Unconfirmed] Character Modification ->
Allowing the playerbase to further modify their TW character's body and face. Height, weight, muscle definition, facial hair,
eyebrow style, scars, eyes, ears etc. This is incredibly important to the game, as it allows players to make their own
characer, unique to every other player in the world. A Unique character will stand out, allow potential roleplay or storyline
to be built and keep players interested in the game. Although some aspects of this should be monetized, such as hairstyles
and tattoos (leaving very few as starters), the majority of the base body customization and facial customization should be
free. No answer to this request as of yet.
 
 3. (4)[Semi-Confirmed] Fighting Styles and Skills ->
New fighting styles to choose from (muay thai, judo, wrestling etc), skill trees for moves and with that, different
animations for counters, grapples and throws. A nice addition to the world of TW, keeping things fresh, however not essintial
for the the core gameplay. Choosing a fighting style (2-3) at the start of the game (including the one in action at the
moment) would be nice, a nod towards saints row 2. However I would not rule out only one fighting style, when you could
utilize the skill tree to unluck certain moves within different styles (mixed martial arts). For example, you could judo
throw someone to take down and focus on arm bars and locks to cripple enemies, but use a standing fight stance of a muay thai
fighter. This also might be useful with customizating your gang members fighting style. The devs have confirmed that there
will be skill trees for different moves, however no word on different fighting
styles in its entirety yet. If you count the fighting styles already in the game a mix of karate, wing chun and jujitsu would
be included If I am not wrong.

 4. (5)[Unconfirmed] Walking Style ->
Another unnecessary yet nice feature to have. Having a few variants of movement to choose from (vaulting animations can stay
the same), Including a walking animation, as well as jogging and running. Only a few variants need to be included (3-4) as
each will give off a distinct aura for their character. Styles such as Tough/Threatening, Classy, Default, Crazy etc. Since
this would be classed as customization, there should be no problem selling these styles in gold. 

 5. (5)[Unconfirmed] Substance Usage ->
Whether this affects the actual gameplay (vision imparement, slower movement etc), It is just a immersive feature for the
world of TW. Consuming alcohol, sniffing a line or popping a pill, your character should be able to do it all as he/she is a
crime lord after all. Not necessary for gameplay, but would be a nice little feature and help players really feel like they
are in the gang world.

 6. (5)[Unconfirmed] Miscellaneous animations ->
Whether this will be added in later as more features are introduced or as a standalone addition, animations such as laughing,
dancing, bowing etc. that can be used by your character would help enhance social features and immerse players in their
gameplay.

 7. (3)[Unconfirmed] Saving outfits ->
Adding the ability to save your outfits would be very useful, as it not only saves time swtiching in between clothes, but
allows players to sort their clothing inventory. Having this feature in the game would only be more and more useful as time
goes on and more clothing is added.

- *Vehicles and Customization:*
-

 1. (4)[Unconfirmed] Greater range of Vehicles ->
Pedal bikes, boats, more cars etc need to be added. Wether this is by the community (read post towards the end) or the devs
doesn't really matter at the current time. One thing that will need to be added though, is 2-3 cars which can be bought with
a large sum of cash rather than gold. Once fine tuning of driving controls is fixed, this should move further up in
priority. No words from the devs yet.

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Modifying Vehicles ->
Another highly requested addition by the community, being able modify and make your own one of a kind vehicle (appearance
wise) would really help the world of TW expand. Paint jobs, Roll cages, Applying custom emblems (see at end of thread),
Changing rims, and all perfomance mods should eventually be available, to have full control of your ride. Custom license
plates would also be great for a unique vehicl. Performance mods should not only have slight appearance changes (e.g NOS in
back seat), but apply changes to the cars performance. Balancing will need to take place before any car mod releases (Engine
A 10%+ speed, 10%- handling, Engine B 10%-speed 10%+ handling). No words from the dev on this yet!

 3. (5)[Unconfirmed] Pink Slips ->
If racing is added in the future, you would be able to bet many things (see below), however if both parties agree, a high
profile race will bet on a pink slip (the ownership of the losers car). Racing must be implemented before this can be
considered.

4. (4)[Unconfirmed] Renting ->
Perhaps being able to rent a car would help the immersion of the game, yet also allow some players to test cars before
permanently buying cars (renting will be ingame cash and give the player a 1hour favour of their selected vehicle). Obviously
rented vehicles won't be able to be modded, customized, or used in specific events (races, derby etc). The possibility for
players to rent their vehicles to other players would be nice too.

 5. (2)[Unconfirmed] Player Vehicle marker on minimap/map ->
Another simple yet useful feature that will allow players to see where they last left their vehicle. Unconfirmed at the
current time.

- *Weapons and Customization:*
- 

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Greater range of weapons ->
To be at home in the Triad Wars atmosphere. we need more weapons, some makeshift weapons that give of that thug vibe, some of
which the elite members or professional hitmen would use. (:P). To add to this atmosphere melee weapons such as steel chains,
butterfly knives, dual small kitchen knives, nunchucks, quarterstaff, sledgegammer, 2x4 wooden plank and perhaps brass
knuckles are just some of the many weapons that could enhance the TW world. There are currently not many requests for ranged
weapons, but the two I saw requested, was a sawn off shotgun and duel wielding of pistols. No confirmation from the devs
currently of upcoming weapons.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Weapon Mods ->
 Weapon mods don't seem to be essential in the TW universe or as needed as other content, but it would be nice to be able to
customize your weapons with colors, decals and perhaps even some property changing mods, such as laser sights, muzzles and
stocks. Silencers would also be added if stealth mode is released (missions and gamemodes) No words from the Devs on this
yet.

- *Balances, Tuning and/or Reworks:*
-

 1. (1)[Unconfirmed] Fine tuning of driving and running ->
Running, which seems to be a lot better with the controller (understandably), can be quite frustrating on the keyboard. One
of the major issues is the autoclimb/vault, which can run you into walls, places you don't want to go, and even get you
stuck, making it hell in small areas. It does not seem to autoclimb on the xbox controller, but with the keyboard it will
automatically do it, if this is intentional or not I am unsure. The driving, which is much smoother than the walking, still
has some issues, feeling a lot less smooth than the original sleeping dogs for some reason. Making it more reactive to input
and slightly upping the horizontal handling on all vehicles should fix this. 

 2. (2)[Unconfirmed] XP Modifiers ->
Different kills, whether it is with a vehicle, gun, melee, a type of kill, environment, headshot etc, there should be
modifiers to the default XP. (special thanks to CrownTheJules)(These xp values are obviously subject to change due to the
devs decisions. This is simply a placeholder) 10xp bonus for a headshot, 100xp for clearing a racket without taking damage,
20xp bonus for an environmental kill, Cripple kill enemy 10xp bonus, Killing enemy with open car door 25xp bonus, vault kill
10xp bonus, Killing 2 enemies in 5 sec: 10 extra xp, Killing 3 enemies in 9 sec: 15 extra xp, killing 4 enemies in less than
12 sec: 20 extra xp and so on, finish entire turf taking 0 damage, 250 xp bonus. 

 3. (2)[Unconfirmed] Collect all and Fill all queues (rackets) ->
Nothing to hard to implement, but relieves some annoyance from having to spam click in later levels. Would allow players to
collect all finished queues from a racket, and fill it up again. No confirmation yet.

 4. (2)[Unconfirmed] Chance to lose staff when raided lowered, rather than 100% rate ->
Makes it easier to maintain a healthy staff, as staff cards can sometimes be difficult to get. Would give staff a decent
chance of surviving an attack. No confirmation yet.

 5. (2)[Unconfirmed] Sell All/Buy select amount (warehouse/market) ->
Just a nice feature to have and a time saver. Players would be able to sell all or a select amount of items from their
warehouse. They would also be able to buy a select amount. No confirmation yet.

 6. (3)[Unconfirmed] Larger friends list and ability to cancel pending requests ->
In the universe of TW why limit yourself to only a certain amount of contacts. Friends list should be expanded and the
ability to cancel pending friend requests also would be useful (ie Accidently added wrong username, or added an AI). No
response yet.

 7. (3)[Unconfirmed] Recoil ->
With no recoil in the game, it makes it incredibly easy to easily wipe out rackets with consecutive headshots fired less than
seconds apart. Whilst it wouldn't be a good idea to rock your whole screen with recoil, a small lift (perhaps even a recoil
reduction skill added in too) when firing your gun would be nice. No confirmation yet.

 8. (2)[Unconfirmed] NPC gun damage ->
Currently, players can play through every raid without ever having the need to take cover. Getting killed in one to two 
shots would be incredibly annoying, but increasing the NPC's damage with guns (5-10% more) would be nice to the point where
players would have to take cover, planning their approach and chosing when to rush in, rather than just effortlessly killing
groups of armed thugs like they were flies.

 9. (1)[Unconfirmed] Camera Fixes ->
Generally the camera for TW is quite good, however when close to a wall, in a tight space or fighting hand to hand, many
issues can arise. When close to a wall or in a tight space, the camera will lock, not allowing the player to adjust the
angle, sometimes leaving players looking at walls, away from their character, not allowing players to change their combat
target and/or zooming in or out, giving very awkard views of the surroundings. The same can also be said when using firearms,
as it will auto zoom in and out, forcing players to readjust their aim, wasting time and possibly getting them killed. (Aim
view is usually great, but tight spaces in rackets can cause issues as stated).

 10. (1)[Unconfirmed] Player movement on foot (expanded) ->
Expanding on topic 1. in this section, auto sprint and auto climb are two very annoying issues that occur only on keyboard
when players press/hold the space key. Rather than just sprinting stopping when the shift key is released, characters will
continue to sprint, forcing players to stop moving to be able to jog/walk again. When using an xbox controller this is not
the case, as characters will stop sprinting immediately. Another issue with the shift key is auto climbing, causing
characters to auto vault over objects while sprinting (and even a few seconds after pressing the shift key!),run up walls and
sometimes even get stuck in objects.

 11. (3)[Unconfirmed] Favour Crafting ->
Rather than just allowing players to trade in favours for gold, why not allow them to craft favours from others? For example,
crafting 4 common favours will give one random rare ravour -> 4 rares will give an ultra rare and so on. This will give
players a reason to collect multiple favours and give every favour a slightly increased value to the TW world.

 12. (1)[Unconfirmed] Button Remapping ->
A simple yet necessary feature which will allow players to remapp their buttongs. Quite important for keyboard users.

 13. (2)[Unconfirmed] Player Vehicle sign on minimap/map ->
Another simple yet useful feature that will allow players to see where they last left their vehicle. Unconfirmed at the
current time.

- *Safehouse and Customization:*
- 

 1. (4)[Unconfirmed] Safe House customization ->
 Being able to make your own hideout unique and 'yours' is almost as important as your character itself. Furniture layout,
furniture options and perhaps even purchasable furniture in the future will be a possibility. Personally this is one of the
things I am looking forward to he most in TW. Raiding someone and seeing their unique character and home will leave an
impression, this is just another option in which TW can reward players for their creativity, by giving them the
chance to make a home to be able to show off. Coop experience later on could also allow other users to visit players
safehouses. Although this would require another instance for the safehouse, it would then be pssoble to add multiple floors
(would cost alot) to the safehouse, giving us the option for some themed rooms (bedroom, bathroom, gym, roof etc).
Unconfirmed so far, but we can always hope :). 

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Broken Elevator upgraded to Personal Garage ->
A personal garage where you can display a set number of cars as well as a nice area to loiter. As well as the safehouse, the
garage should be able to be visited by friends. Either levelling up your safehouse will level up the garage, or a seperate
tier, with garage customization options avaiable for the TW community. Minigames such as majong or arm wrestling should be
available if purchased here. An original idea, so no confirmation from staff as of yet.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Expanding on Safe House (read above) ->
 Allow players to add extra floor to their safe house (these will not be seen in a raid) that they can customize. Floors and
rooms such as Bath house, Beedroom, Garage (above) Rooftop, Lounge etc should be available to add and customize. Since this
is purely cosmetic, this should be in gold. Allow other players to visit. No confirmation yet.

 4. (3)[Unconfirmed] Safes or Stashes inside player Safehouses ->
A great idea from funkeemonkee where when raiding a player, you can choose to also attempt to raid their safe/stash for more
reward, however it either takes time (30-1min off) or is a hard lockpicking attempt (failure to lockpick gets you arrested).
This will increase the reward for raiding, however add risk also, causing players to make decisions mid raid as to whether it
is worth it or not.

- *Racket Tech Tree:*
- 

 1. (3)[Confirmed] More Racket Branches ->
A new racket branch should be coming next patch according to the devs. However, new trees ever now and then would be nice.
The community seems to agree that we need one for drugs (cooking, selling, trading). One for the red light district (massage
parlour, Brothel, XXX store). One for human trafficking (Organ harvesting, dealing and Black market trades). Hopefully more
to come! The branch the devs have confirmed will have to do more with smuggling, perhaps including a portion in water (boat).

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Stacking Rackets ->
Being able to build up rather than across would be awesome, and really shot the expansion of your turf. Quite a few users
have requested this, and personally I think it's an awesome idea. The amount of stacked rackets you can create should be
limited (only 2-3 stacked small or 1 medium building) it should also cost double the amount it would to build and upgrade on
a fresh turf building slot. It would also be quite interesting if small buffs were given to buildings that related to
eachother being stacked. (for example a smuggling building stacked on a fishing building would give 5% more profit). Unsure
as of yet if bracket managers should be allowed on the stack. No response yet as i assume devs will be busy with the release
of the next racket branch.

- *Turf and Turf Manager:*
-

 1. (3)[Semi-Confirmed] Larger Turf ->
With racket expansion on the horizon, it is inevitable that the players turf will need to expand to house a few of these new
rackets. Racket slots added into turf, how many depends on the number of new rackets. Devs have hinted at this, though there
is no official statement as of yet.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Style of buildings ->
A few options added in for each players turf (preferably around 4-5) of which they can choose to govern the architectual
style of their rackets and warehouse (perhaps even the outside of the safehouse). From neon skyline-esque buildings to
traditional chinese, players should have a choice of what theme they'd like for their turf. Another original idea, so no
confirmation yet.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Turf for triad -> A large turf for each triad, which has many features that will
enchance the coop (potential free roam and pvp) experience. The warehouse in this turf should allow for limitless
tradingbetween the gang. Other buildings in this turf may include a gang base, nightclub, coop activities etc. Hobbie
buildings (seen below) should either be built in turfs for triads or just included in world. Not yet confirmed.

- *External Applications and Websites/Forums:*
-

 1. (2)[Unconfirmed] Phone App for Managing Turf ->
People may be busy with work or real life issues, not able to log on, however this app will allow people to manage their turf
away from the pc (obviously they are still able to be raided and cannot raid whilst on their phone). This has been requested
many times, yet no definitive response from the devs as of yet.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Subforum for Guides for TW ->
Community content driven subforum, where players can post what works, and what dosent in turf combinations, raiding
strategies, levelling strategies etc. A nice feature that would bring a select number of the player base closer together. No
word from the devs yet.

- *Chat and Social hub:*
-

 1. (5)[Unconfirmed] Ability to take selfies ->
A very non-essential yet fun and immersive feature that could be implemented into the TW world. Just raided someones base?
Take a selfie of yourself smiling over their dead goons and send the picture straight to them!. This could also be used with
a small caption, popping up on the right tab of your personal page whenever a friend posts a selfie. New outfits, cars,
houses etc can all be shown off.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Messages to friends look like texts ->
Also non-essential, yet an immersive feature that could be added to the game to make it seem like you are actually part of
the world. Perhaps even an animation of your character bringing up their phone when you open your messages would be a nice
little feature.

 3. (3)[Unconfirmed] Letting you message in a raid and/Or showing friend status (IN RAID) ->
With all buttons locked whenever you are in combat or raiding, you are unable to properly read and respond to messages. I
don't see why not, however your message menu should not pause the game, giving you an unfair advantage mid raid. A Raid
symbol next to your friends name would let you know they are busy and might take a while to respond. No response as of yet
from the dev team.

 4. (3)[Unconfirmed] Larger friends list ->
(see above in rework section)

 5. (4)[Unconfirmed] Biography(Background story) ->
Just a small feature to be added to someones profile that will help immerse the player into the world of TW. Good for rp and
just having fun in TW, can't really see any downside from it. No response yet.

 6. (4)[Unconfirmed] Access to forums by your social hub ->
Not necessary, yet a nice feature to enhance TW. Will allow players to access and post to TW forums (perhaps even accessing
the guide forum) straight through their game.

- *Hobbies and Favours:*
- 
 1. (2)[Unconfirmed] Proper Timer for Favours ->
Rather than just showing the card is active (e.g. card a (72 hours) ), show the remaining time left on it (e.g. card A, 72
hours, 10 hours remaining). 

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Favour Crafting ->
Rather than just allowing players to trade in favours for gold, why not allow them to craft favours from others? For example,
crafting 4 common favours will give one random rare ravour -> 4 rares will give an ultra rare and so on. This will give
players a reason to collect multiple favours and give every favour a slightly increased value to the TW world.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Hobbie buildings (expanded directly below) ->
Buildings that contain various fun things to do (coop compatible). Some of these buildings would be Karaoke (sing to your
hearts content, with or without friends), Gambling (A gambling house to set wagers for races, fight club, and perhaps some
random casino games like poker), night club to dance and listen to music (perhaps a player could stream live music).

 4. (4)[Unconfirmed] The Fight Club ->
The fight club from the beloved Sleeping Dogs, but with a twist. Come to the fight club to practise your combos, new moves
and spar npcs. But most importantly, Train your fighter. This all new addition to Fight Club will allow players to train
their own npc, level him/her up and eventually fight another players npc (which can be watched and bet on). This will be sure
to create a new renewed love the the fight club, Sifu Kwok would be proud! (included after hobbie buildings)

 5. (5)[Unconfirmed] The Registry -> 
If community content is accepted and begins taking shape, the monthly poll to accept new items to be added into the game will
need to take place somewhere. The registry does that for you, showing the top 100 or so entries, vote for what you want in
TW! No point adding this unless community content goes ahead. (included after hobbie buildings)

 6. (5)[Unconfirmed] Car Derby ->
What's not to love about a car derby built into TW? A Car derby is when two or more people (players) will enter an arena in
their cars. The objective is to ram, flip, damage and just destroy the other contestants cars. The last player left will be
victorious, receiving a reward of some sort. This could be integrated into TW by either accessing a match through the
gambling house (seen below) or an inbuilt arena in the world or a triad's turf. Perhaps Derby points could be rewarded to a
victor of a match, to which they can spend towards rewards at the Derby store (e.g. 10 Derby points for 100k cash, or a
Unique Derby hat.)

 7. (5)[Unconfirmed] Karaoke Bar ->
Karaoke as mentioned many times throughout this collaboration list, has been highly requested by the community as a
single/coop player activity. With a Karaoke Bar located either in a triad turf or in world, this would be where players would
take a break from the gangster life, singing to their hearts content about love lost and their childhood :P.

 8. (5)[Unconfirmed] Night Club ->
A great idea suggested by a few of my TW friends, where a triad will be able to own and manage a nightclub, choosing what
they want to build,focus on. For example one nightclub could be filled with drugs, club music and strippers if a triad
focuses mainly on their drug trade and aggression, whilst another club would be an elite lounge for the rich and famous, for
the Triad that focuses on the Black Market and blackmail. Obviously these are just examples, and a Triad owned nightclub
could be any combination of these and inbetween. If free roam/Coop in introduced, it would be a nice place for friends and
triad members to relax whilst waiting for the next raid or queue on a racket.

 9. (4)[Unconfirmed] Gambling House/Casino ->
The Central hub for all hobbies/events (coop or otherwise) that will use bets (money, items, cars etc). This will be where
you set up races, bets for various events (still accessible from their buildings, though bettable through the gambling
house). Mini games for single player and coop could also be added here, such as poker, mahjong etc. Gamling houses would be available in world and/or at a triads turf.
 
- *Store and Events:*
- 

 1. (5)[Semi-Confirmed] Holiday or event themed items ->
Items, events and objects that represent specific events that will temporarily be available for purchase. From small things,
like buying mistletoe for your safehouse, or something big like an outfit to dress up as winston or wei for halloween. This
will help keep things fresh, without breaking the lore of TW and bringing in a decent profit for the devs to fund the game.
No confirmation of any specific item yet.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] "---" of the week deal ->
If the community items do come to play, A dev or community vote will decide the favourite set for that specific week (e.g.
car a with rims c and light b for 15% total discount. Or shirt, shoes and shorts for 15% discount) and it will be put on a
flash sale for a few hours. No point implementing this until there are more things in the store to choose from.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Choosing Color of item bought with gold ->
After purchasing an item bought with gold (clothes, hair, cars, etc) spending ingame cash to recolor your item should be an
option. Further modification (such as the community customizer, mods for your cars etc) should still be in gold. No word from
the devs yet!

- *Coop and other Player interaction:*
- 

 1. (1)[Confirmed] Coop Raids ->
Raiding people with a friend, what not to love? Probably the 1. most requested feature in TW, and the devs have granted our
wish. This is confirmed, and in the works. Details of what will change in the coop, how favours will function and if it will
influence rewards are not yet revealed. Sit tight for more info.

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Bounties -> 
Place a bountie on another player, wether it is to annoy your friend, hinder an enemy or just to be a pain in the rear,
Bounties should be able to be offered in cash or items (warehouse). A player who takes the said bounty would then raid the
person, receiving nothing for it but the bounty and face. (looted items will go to the person who placed the bounty). This
idea is credited to CrownTheJules, and is currently unanswered.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Join instances with friends ->
Whether this is having fun at karaoke, Hitting up clubs, Having an arm wrestle, hanging around at a friend's turf or kicking
back in the safehouse, It would all be that much more fun with a friend.. or two! No answer to this at the moment, but we
hope!

 4. (4)[Unconfirmed] Free Roam ->
Free roaming in Honk Kong with your buddies, what's not to love? Though it is understandable that there are many features and
a whole lot of work that needs to be put in before this can become a reality, don't rule it out yet. The map for free roam
would be much like the normal one, however your neighbours (usually rivals) are either friends you have invited to join your
free roam, or members of your gang. Players could move from the city streets, to Hobbie buildings, Safe houses and Personal
Garages (read above) that would allow people to interact with eachother through activities and just conversating. It would
not be a good idea to allow pvp in free roam, however with popular demand, perhaps a pvp mode which would occur in a
sectioned off part of the map would not be a bad idea. Official races should also be kept seperate from free roam instances.
No word from the devs about this yet.

 5. (3)[Unconfirmed] Communication ->
When playing with a friend, you might just warn him/her about that red dot pointing at the back of their head, but how do we
do this? Voice communication is one option, preferably accessible through the chat screen (if it is reworked as a phone
overlay) A player can call and communicate with one or more friends via voice chat. Common messages. If in an instance of
more than yourself (coop +) you can press enter to type and talk to friends that are close to you. Gestures. More for comedic
relief, but can also contain some useful ones, gestures can be used to quickly warn a friend about that npc sneaking up on
then ("careful", "behind you", "take cover" gestures) for serious play, and then some gestures to have fun with, such as
dances and other miscellaneous things (e.g. Flex, Nod etc).

 6. (4)[Unconfirmed] Robbing/Mugging ->
A feature that can bring a lot of fun to the game either single player or coop, would be the ability to rob people and
places. Starting from robbing a pedestrian -> a store -> a bank. Each would have their own risks and rewards. Not much news
on this yet, please let me know if you have any ideas for it!

 7. (4)[Unconfirmed] Player-built Missions ->
Allowing players to customize random missions (single player and multiplayer), whether its a time race through the busy
straights of HK, Fighting off 12 very hard NPCs, Delivering a package on foot whilst multiple ambushes try to stop you etc.
This well keep the game feeling fresh and alive for years to come.

 8. (3)[Unconfirmed] Player-Player Trading and Selling ->
Rather than just selling and using resources for your rackets and warehouse, add the option to trade resources
between players (perhaps money too, however it would need to near the cost of resources to avoid exploitation). It would help
enhance the financial side of TW and increase the social aspects. No confirmation yet.

- *Map and Zones:*
- 

 1. (2)[Confirmed] Expanded World ->
Bigger map, unlocking the whole of Hong Kong. Already confirmed by the devs!

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Turf for triad -> A large turf for each triad, which has many features that will
enchance the coop (potential free roam and pvp) experience. The warehouse in this turf should allow for limitless
tradingbetween the gang. Other buildings in this turf may include a gang base, nightclub, coop activities etc. Not yet
confirmed.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Hobbie buildings (Expanded in Hobbies) ->
Buildings that contain various fun things to do (coop compatible). Some of these buildings would be Karaoke (sing to your
hearts content, with or without friends), Gambling (A gambling house to set wagers for races, fight club, and perhaps some
random casino games like poker), night club to dance and listen to music (perhaps a player could stream live music).

- *Bug Fixes:*
- 

 1. (1)[Unconfirmed] Add a respawn option with no penalty ->
You may respawn from the menu (whilst still alive) with no penalty of face loss, however it will put your raid on a cooldown
if you were in one. Just a nice fix to getting stuck, or any bugs showing up in the current beta (unnaccessible rackets etc)
No words from the devs yet.

 2. (1)[Unconfirmed] Rackets empty/No spawns ->
Sometimes when raiding a racket (opening new door, or going upstairs) there will be no npcs there. Players have to run out
and back again to have them spawn.

 3. (2)[Unconfirmed] Gang members stuck running into walls (gang favour cards) ->
Using a favour card to have gang members support you (unkown if this does the same bug with enforcer help) The members will
get stuck at the gate to start the raid, or just run around aimlessly.
 
 4. (3)[Unconfirmed] Floating Objects ->
Seen mostly in the gambling den and warehouse, casino slots will be seen floating, or crates will be floating.

 5. (1)[Unconfirmed] Stuck loading when picking up a favour during raid ->
If not standing completely still when picking up a favour (unkown if this does the same during free roam) players will get an
infinite loading screen, having to restart their TW application.
 
 6. (1)[Unconfirmed] View changes to follow an NPC ->
Very rare bug that has occured to a few people (me included) where the camera will follow a random npc (can't control them)
making you have to restart.
 
 7. (1)[Unconfirmed] During raids Jumping from one building to another (such as onto temple) ->
During raids, it is possible to jump from the top of one building to another. While this seems like a cool feature, you can
jump onto not yet completed rackets, breaking the raid or getting you stuck.
 
 8. (1)[Unconfirmed] Dying whilst Meleeing enemy Enforcer ->
Another rare bug that has happened to few people, where meleeing an enforcer (dosen't matter your hp) you will instantly die.
 
 9. (3)[Unconfirmed] Kicking/Ramming an NPC through a wall ->
Knocking back an NPC, whether by melee, gunshot or car, can sometimes send them through walls.
 
 10. (2)[Unconfirmed] Enemy NPCS running into walls or on the same spot during Raids ->
During raid, enemy npcs will sometimes become stuck running into walls, in the air, or on the same spot in the ground.

 11. (4)[Unconfirmed] Visual Bug completing Rackets ->
Just a small, non-gamebreaking bug where upon completing a Racket, players xp bars will fill to 100% for a second or two
(only visually). 

 12. (3)[Unconfirmed] Tackling through the floor ->
Another non-gamebreaking bug where tackling an npc will briefly bring the npc and player underground, before appearing back
on the ground (NPC is instant killed). 

 13. (1)[Unconfirmed] Bug Submission Through Game ->
Just a simple tool added to game menu that allows players to submit bugs, exploits and other issues they find.



- *Triad and NPCS:*
- 
 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Preplanning of your turfs defence ->
Letting the players not only build their turf, but devise how they want to plan it, will offer a much more strategical aspect
to TW's core gameplay. With an allocated amount of npcs defending, allocate where they will defend (still limited by each
racket minimum and maximum amount of defenders), what they are armed with, and how they behave (aggresive, run for cover,
call reinforcements etc). Allow players to chose the spawn positions of said goons (e.g. two near the elevator, or 3 in
racket A's south side etc). Add mini bosses in each racket (not insanely strong) that is immune to bullets and must be dealt
with melee style. Being about two levels higher than the common goons, the racket mini bosses will not be very hard to beat,
but if you are not careful can pack a punch. Have two mini bosses like these protect the enforcer (your character) when
raided to add some serious pressure. These two personal guards can be eliminated from play by completing a mission before
raiding (like intel gathering for time). One condition I'd personally like to inject would be that you have to beat your own
turf once (you have as many tries as you'd like) before saving your defense settings. This will stop any potential exploits.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Animation fixes for NPCS (most are great) ->
Kissing animation is needed, as npcs will rub their faces together (lol). Perhaps a few more facial expressions, laughing
etc. Other than that I haven't found any animations that need fixes yet.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Rivalries and Alliances ->
Once gangs are able to be created in TW who wouldn't want some friendly competition, or some fierce rivalry! Add the option
to ally with another gang, which will warn members that they are about to raid an ally if they find them in world (They can
still break the alliance if they choose), hopefully keeping the peace between the two gangs. An option for a rival would be
great too. The two gangs would go out of their way to sabotage eachother, constantly raiding, ambushing and being pains in
the backside until one side sumbits.

 4. (4)[Unconfirmed] Ranks within gang ->
Once triads become integrated into the game, leaders of a gang should be able to: promote, demote and recruit more members of
the gang. There should be ranks, at least 10 or so with a hierarchy of power, much like the real triads. The lowest rank will
hold majority of the members, with the number of members in higher ranks lessening until the top two ranks, equivalent to
right hand men and leader should respectively have 2 and 1 member. 

 5. (5)[Unconfirmed] Bribing Police -> Allow players to bribe police for either no police heat, or reduced heat (e.g. instead
of receiving 2 stars for action A your recieve 1 star) for a temporary amount of time. This would be done with a hefty
sum of ingame cash.

 6. (4)[Unconfirmed] Turf for triad -> A large turf for each triad, which has many features that will
enchance the coop (potential free roam and pvp) experience. The warehouse in this turf should allow for limitless
tradingbetween the gang. Other buildings in this turf may include a gang base, nightclub, coop activities etc. Not yet
confirmed.

 7. (5)[Unconfirmed] Random members of your gang in world ->
Whether seeing them relaxing at the park, praying at the temple, sitting on a street corner dealing drugs or tearing it up at
a karaoke joint, this
feature would help liven the world and immerse players in the gang world. If gang customization does get added (see below
this post) this feature would be even better! No words from the dev team yet.

 8. (5)[Unconfirmed] Gang customization ->
The ability to customize your gangs appearance would be huge for the TW world. With the help of the community an idea was
forged. A nod to the Saints Row franchise, Slots would be given to each gang member type (grappler, striker etc) How many
slots you have unlocked and customized will decide how many variants of your customized members would appear in game (a mmax
of 4-6 slots per type recommended). A different clothing store for gang members would most likely need to be introduced. No
words from development yet.

 9. (4)[Unconfirmed] Gang Abilities -> 
Taking hold of one of the features from the Sleeping Dog game, your character would be given abilities (car delivery in
world, companion during free roam etc) either obtained via upgrade or through currency. A nice immersive feature that would
really make players feel that their gang is alive and active.


- *Social Interaction and Romances:*
- 

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Loyalty Bar ->
After discussing it with many players at length, we all agreed that a feature like the loyalty bar, which fills as a pair of
people trade, do coop raids, and whatever else in the future would be a great idea. Players with a filled/mostly filled
loyalty bar are granted acess to favours to one another, that if their friend is being raided or ambushed they can choose to
send a group of armed npcs to help out once per day, though they dont have to. (Can already see the potential drama :P).

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Romances ->
Although this will offer no in game benefit, it would be nice to be able to romance other players (regardless of gender),
with a relationship status showing in the players profile (if they choose to show it). Perhaps Stages of romance also (One
Nighter - plaything - girlfriend/boyfriend - Soulmate). (Why couldn't winston get happily married *shakes fists at devs) It
would also enhance any possible RP and just immerse people into the TW universe. No word from the devs yet.

 3. (4)[Unconfirmed] Hate/Revenge Bar ->
Sick of the same guy raiding you over and over? Or just cant beat someones turf, everytime you lose face to someone, you can
rage points towards them. Upon filling, you will get the choice of sending a well armed ambush after them, or some backup the
next time you raid that person. No word from the devs yet.

 4. (4)[Unconfirmed] Family ->
Want to have someone playing with you be a family member in game? Family members will generate loyalty quicker, but will take
a small portion of your profits from time to time (profits go to neither family member). Your family status will show up on
your profile, next to your bio! No response on this yet.

 5. (5)[Unconfirmed] NPC relationships ->
Rather than just limiting relationships between players, why not allow them to have relationships with npc (both genders).
Perhaps make thepotential partner/s customizable? The partner's name (if unique) would still show up in the players
bio/profile. No confirmation yet.

 6. (4)[Unconfirmed] Animations for interaction with NPCS and Players ->
New animations made specifically for interacting with players and npcs. Could tie in to specific interactions for
relationships, friendships, family, insults and others. For relationships some animations such as Kissing, Hugging, Holding
hands would be nice. For friendship, a handshake, nod etc. For family perhaps a hug, bow of respect. Many options for social
interactions will be unlocked with this. No confirmation yet. 

- *Missions and Gamemodes (Raid included):*
- 

 1. (4)[Unconfirmed] Random event whilst raiding ->
Add the posibility for random events whilst raiding (double chance when playing coop raids). For example, if finishing a raid
with less than 30 seconds left, there will be a 20% chance that you have to escape from the police in your getaway car.
Amnbushes are already implemented, however ambushes that can get you during raids should be a posibility if one of your
rivals has a favour card for it. (not yet in game) Unanswered at the moment.

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Conquer ->
In this gamemode (coop compatible) you focus on wiping out a small/weak defence in a specific are, then have to hold it
against either attacking gang members, or a breach from the police (or both!) for a set period of time. Whilst not a huge
gamechanger, gives players something to do when everythings on cooldown.

 3. (3)[Unconfirmed] Race ->
Well.. What do you expect? It's a race! Options for a friendly race, betting cash and items, or if you really want to turn up
the heat, betting pink slips (ownership of your car). The rules can all be set at the Gambling house (hobbie buildings).
Options for traffic on and off, modded or unmodded cars and whether weapons are allowed during this would be great too. I saw
on a post (sorry cant remember your name) about a footrace with implemented parkour, this also sounds great, and can be bet
on the same way (just not with pink slips).

 4. (5)[Unconfirmed] PVP??? ->
PVP due to a large number of requests was just simply so hard to imagine in the Sleeping Dogs engine, so I improvised. A
workaround for 'perma-counters' Would be PVP in a closed map (let's just say the size of a turf right now) between a select
number of people, In a fight club or defending a raid. Melee is disabled, letting your character only shoot and melee with
the gun out (the pistol whip and kick for the pistol). Dodges would have to either be disabled also, or the time frame to
dodge would be must smaller. It seems that many things would need to be edited and changed for pvp, so the priority here is
5, simply because the devs need to work on the actual game before thinking of pvp!

 5. (3)[Unconfirmed] Raid Preplanning and Random missions for Favour ->
New missions added will help keep the game feeling fresh and new. Missions such as assassination (kill someone, lose cops), 

 6. (4)[Unconfirmed] Robbing/Mugging ->
A feature that can bring a lot of fun to the game either single player or coop, would be the ability to rob people and
places. Starting from robbing a pedestrian -> a store -> a bank. Each would have their own risks and rewards. Not much news
on this yet, please let me know if you have any ideas for it!

 7. (4)[Unconfirmed] Stealth Raids ->
Allow players to complete Rackets (not the whole raid, since the safehouse and temple would be silly) in stealth mode. Bonus
xp would be awarded for this. New combat features would be added, such as sneaking, silencers, instant melee takedowns
(perhaps a quicktime sequence or silent takedown). No Words from the devs on this yet.

 8. (4)[Unconfirmed] Player-built Missions ->
Allowing players to customize random missions (single player and multiplayer), whether its a time race through the busy
straights of HK, Fighting off 12 very hard NPCs, Delivering a package on foot whilst multiple ambushes try to stop you etc.
This well keep the game feeling fresh and alive for years to come.

 9. (4)[Unconfirmed] Random Events In World ->
Random events during free roam, things that were included in Sleeping dogs and many others such as stop a theif, help gang
member fend off enemies etc. This will keep the world feeling alive. Perhaps in the future other players could join these
events for either PVP or coop.

- *Community Input:*
- 

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Creation Kit ->
A kit created by the devs that contains simple -> intricate patterns, lines and color selection etc, that will allow players
to create their own clothing, (on top of a plain existing model of clothing of course, like v-necks) tattoos, shoes,
accessories (custom mask etc), decals for cars, emblems for gang. The original of the item must be owned first (buying plain
version of clothing in shop) This will allow players to have one of a kind patterns that no one else has, giving each player
the opportunity to feel unique and make a name for themselves. I am sure the community would be fine with the devs selling
this kit as a pack, as long as it is a reasonable price $10-$20. If you need reference material, APB reloaded's pattern maker
is a good comparison.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Community Made Items ->
Simply put, Items you can find now in the vehicles tab and clothing, hair, weapons etc, some of these will be made by the
community. Rather than having thousands of items pouring in, the community will make a pol, voting their favourite 5-10 items
of the week/month/whatever period of time via screenshots on the forum, and they will added to the game. Other than very few
items which could be available in ingame cash, the rest will still cost gold, giving the creator of item a select amount of
the profit, another amount going back to the devs. There are many examples of this model being extremely profitable and
encouraging creativity in the community, as seen in CS:GO where majority of the guns you buy in cases, are community made, or
SecondLife, where 99% of the content is community made.
