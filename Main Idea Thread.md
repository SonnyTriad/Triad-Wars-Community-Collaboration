# Triad-Wars-Community-Collaboration
Ideas I have seen requested many times! Helping out the devs with the sorting! - Sonny

First and foremost I have no legal claims and am not interested in claiming any of the ideas I put here, they are merely suggestions that I have seen that the community thinks would make the game better. The staff of Triad Wars has my permission to use these ideas.

Priotity System: I will class ideas from a (1) to a (5). 1 being detrimental to the game's success or very highly requested by the community, 5 being very low in priority, but a nice addition further along the games lifespan.

Updates and new ideas: New ideas Will briefly mentioned here, and confirmation or cancellation of a suggestion (current version 1.0)
