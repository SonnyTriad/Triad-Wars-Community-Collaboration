# Triad-Wars-Community-Collaboration
Ideas I have seen requested many times! Helping out the devs with the sorting! - Sonny
Special Thanks to BridgetKFisher for making this possible :) Also a big thanks to Handsome-Jack and CrowntTheJules for some
of the ideas here below!


First and foremost I have no legal claims and am not interested in claiming any of the ideas I put here, they are merely
suggestions that I have seen that the community thinks would make the game better. The staff of Triad Wars has my permission
to use these ideas.


**Priotity System:** I will class ideas from a (1) to a (5). 1 being detrimental to the game's success or very highly
requested by the community, 5 being very low in priority, but a nice addition further along the games lifespan.


**Updates and new ideas:** New ideas will be briefly mentioned here, and confirmation or cancellation of a suggestion
(current version 1.0)


- **THREAD STARTS HERE!**


- *Character Customization and Loadout:*
-

 1. (2)[Confirmed] Female Character ->
This has been requested multiple times by the Community as it will
allow the playerbase to play as a female, expanding the story possibilities into the Triad Wars Universe. Although
this is confirmed, A lot of work must be done first, such as voice actors, new animations, playermodel etc. "already on our
list of things to do" - Dev team.

 2. (2-3)[Unconfirmed] Character Modification ->
Allowing the playerbase to further modify their TW character's body and face. Height, weight, muscle definition, facial hair,
eyebrow style, scars, eyes, ears etc. This is incredibly important to the game, as it allows players to make their own
characer, unique to every other player in the world. A Unique character will stand out, allow potential roleplay or storyline
to be built and keep players interested in the game. Although some aspects of this should be monetized, such as hairstyles
and tattoos (leaving very few as starters), the majority of the body customization and facial customization should be free.
No answer to this request as of yet.
 
 3. (4)[Semi-Confirmed] Fighting Styles and Skills ->
New fighting styles to choose from (muay thai, judo, wrestling etc), skill trees for moves and with that, different
animations for counters, grapples and throws. A nice addition to the world of TW, keeping things fresh, however not essintial
for the the core gameplay. Choosing a fighting style (2-3) at the start of the game (including the one in action at the
moment) would be nice, a nod towards saints row 2. However I would not rule out only one fighting style, when you could
utilize the skill tree to unluck certain moves within different styles (mixed martial arts). For example, you could judo
throw someone to take down and focus on arm bars and locks to cripple enemies, but use a standing fight stance of a muay thai
fighter. This also might be useful with customizating your gang members fighting style. The devs have confirmed that there
will be skill trees for different moves, however no word on different fighting
styles in its entirety yet. If you count the fighting styles already in the game a mix of karate, wing chun and jujitsu would
be included If I am not wrong.

- *Vehicles and Customization:*
-

 1. (4)[Unconfirmed] Greater range of Vehicles ->
Pedal bikes, boats, more cars etc need to be added. Wether this is by the community (read post towards the end) or the devs
doesn't really matter at the current time. One thing that will need to be added though, is 2-3 cars which can be bought with
a large sum of cash rather than gold. Once fine tuning of driving controls is fixed, this should move further up in
priority. No words from the devs yet.

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Modifying Vehicles ->
Another highly requested addition by the community, being able modify and make your own one of a kind vehicle (appearance
wise) would really help the world of TW expand. Paint jobs, Applying custom emblems (see at end of thread), Changing rims,
and all perfomance mods should eventually be available, to have full control of your ride. Performance mods should not only
have slight appearance changes (e.g NOS in back seat), but apply changes to the cars performance. Balancing will need to take
place before any car mod releases (Engine A 10%+ speed, 10%- handling, Engine B 10%-speed 10%+ handling). No words from the
dev on this yet!

 3. (5)[Unconfirmed] Pink Slips ->
If racing is added in the future, you would be able to bet many things (see below), however if both parties agree, a high
profile race will bet on a pink slip (the ownership of the losers car). Racing must be implemented before this can be
considered.

- *Weapons and Customization:*
- 

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Greater range of weapons ->
To be at home in the Triad Wars atmosphere. we need more weapons, some makeshift weapons that give of that thug vibe, some of
which the elite members or professional hitmen would use. (:P). To add to this atmosphere melee weapons such as steel chains,
dual small kitchen knives, nunchucks, quarterstaff, sledgegammer, 2x4 wooden plank and perhaps brass knuckles are just some
of the many weapons that could enhance the TW world. There are currently not many requests for ranged weapons, but the two I
saw requested, was a sawn off shotgun and duel wielding of pistols. No confirmation from the devs currently of upcoming
weapons.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Weapon Mods ->
 Weapon mods don't seem to be essential in the TW universe or as needed as other content, but it would be nice to be able to
customize your weapons with colors, decals and perhaps even some property changing mods, such as laser sights, muzzles and
stocks. No words from the Devs on this yet.

- *Balances, Tuning and/or Reworks:*
-

 1. (1)[Unconfirmed] Fine tuning of driving and running ->
Running, which seems to be a lot better with the controller (understandably), can be quite frustrating on the keyboard. One
of the major issues is the autoclimb/vault, which can run you into walls, places you don't want to go, and even get you
stuck, making it hell in small areas. It does not seem to autoclimb on the xbox controller, but with the keyboard it will
automatically do it, if this is intentional or not I am unsure. The driving, which is much smoother than the walking, still
has some issues, feeling a lot less smooth than the original sleeping dogs for some reason. Making it more reactive to input
and slightly upping the horizontal handling on all vehicles should fix this. 

 2. (2)[Unconfirmed] XP Modifiers ->
Different kills, whether it is with a vehicle, gun, melee, a type of kill, environment, headshot etc, there should be
modifiers to the default XP. (special thanks to CrownTheJules)(These xp values are obviously subject to change due to the
devs decisions. This is simply a placeholder) 10xp bonus for a headshot, 100xp for clearing a racket without taking damage,
20xp bonus for an environmental kill, Cripple kill enemy 10xp bonus, Killing enemy with open car door 25xp bonus, vault kill
10xp bonus, Killing 2 enemies in 5 sec: 10 extra xp, Killing 3 enemies in 9 sec: 15 extra xp, killing 4 enemies in less than
12 sec: 20 extra xp and so on, finish entire turf taking 0 damage, 250 xp bonus. 

 3. (2)[Unconfirmed] Collect all and Fill all queues (rackets) ->
Nothing to hard to implement, but relieves some annoyance from having to spam click in later levels. Would allow players to
collect all finished queues from a racket, and fill it up again. No confirmation yet.

 4. (2)[Unconfirmed] Chance to lose staff in raid lowered, rather than 100% rate ->
Makes it easier to maintain a healthy staff, as staff cards can sometimes be difficult to get. Would give staff a decent
chance of surviving an attack. No confirmation yet.

 5. (2)[Unconfirmed] Sell All/Buy select amount (warehouse/market) ->
Just a nice feature to have and a time saver. Players would be able to sell all or a select amount of items from their
warehouse. They would also be able to buy a select amount. No confirmation yet.

 6. (3)[Unconfirmed] Larger friends list and ability to cancel pending requests ->
In the universe of TW why limit yourself to only a certain amount of contacts. Friends list should be expanded and the
ability to cancel pending friend requests also would be useful (ie Accidently added wrong username, or added an AI). No response yet.

- *Safehouse and Customization:*
- 

 1. (4)[Unconfirmed] Safe House customization ->
 Being able to make your own hideout unique and 'yours' is almost as important as your character itself. Furniture layout,
furniture options and perhaps even purchasable furniture in the future will be a possibility. Personally this is one of the
things I am looking forward to he most in TW. Raiding someone and seeing their unique character and home will leave an
impression, this is just another option in which TW can reward players for their creativity, by giving them the
chance to make a home to be able to show off. Coop experience later on could also allow other users to visit players
safehouses. Although this would require another instance for the safehouse, it would then be pssoble to add multiple floors
(would cost alot) to the safehouse, giving us the option for some themed rooms (bedroom, bathroom, gym, etc). Unconfirmed so
far, but we can always hope :). 

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Broken Elevator upgraded to Personal Garage ->
A personal garage where you can display a set number of cars as well as a nice area to loiter. As well as the safehouse, the
garage should be able to be visited by friends. Either levelling up your safehouse will level up the garage, or a seperate
tier, with garage customization options avaiable for the TW community. Minigames such as majong or arm wrestling should be
available if purchased here. An original idea, so no confirmation from staff as of yet.

- *Racket Tech Tree:*
- 

 1. (3)[Confirmed] More Racket Branches ->
A new racket branch should be coming next patch according to the devs. However, new trees ever now and then would be nice.
The community seems to agree that we need one for drugs (cooking, selling, trading). One for the red light district (massage
parlour, Brothel, XXX store). One for human trafficking (Organ harvesting, dealing and Black market trades). Hopefully more
to come! The branch the devs have confirmed will have to do more with smuggling, perhaps including a portion in water (boat).

 2. (3)[Unconfirmed] Stacking Rackets ->
Being able to build up rather than across would be awesome, and really shot the expansion of your turf. Quite a few users
have requested this, and personally I think it's an awesome idea. The amount of stacked rackets you can create should be
limited (only 2-3 stacked small or 1 medium building) it should also cost double the amount it would to build and upgrade on
a fresh turf building slot. It would also be quite interesting if small buffs were given to buildings that related to
eachother being stacked. (for example a smuggling building stacked on a fishing building would give 5% more profit). No response yet as i assume devs will be busy with the release of the next racket branch.

- *Turf and Turf Manager:*
-

 1. (3)[Semi-Confirmed] Larger Turf ->
With racket expansion on the horizon, it is inevitable that the players turf will need to expand to house a few of these new
rackets. Racket slots added into turf, how many depends on the number of new rackets. Devs have hinted at this, though there
is no official statement as of yet.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Style of buildings ->
A few options added in for each players turf (preferably around 4-5) of which they can choose to govern the architectual
style of their rackets and warehouse (perhaps even the outside of the safehouse). From neon skyline-esque buildings to
traditional chinese, players should have a choice of what theme they'd like for their turf. Another original idea, so no
confirmation yet.
 
- *External Applications and Websites/Forums:*
-

 1. (2)[Unconfirmed] Phone App for Managing Turf ->
People may be busy with work or real life issues, not able to log on, however this app will allow people to manage their turf
away from the pc (obviously they are still able to be raided and cannot raid whilst on their phone). This has been requested
many times, yet no definitive response from the devs as of yet.

 2. (5)[Unconfirmed] Subforum for Guides for TW ->
Community content driven subforum, where players can post what works, and what dosent in turf combinations, raiding
strategies, levelling strategies etc. A nice feature that would bring a select number of the player base closer together. No
word from the devs yet.

- *Chat and Social hub:*
-

 1. (5)[Unconfirmed] Ability to take selfies ->
A very non-essential yet fun and immersive feature that could be implemented into the TW world. Just raided someones base?
Take a selfie of yourself smiling over their dead goons and send the picture straight to them!. This could also be used with
a small caption, popping up on the right tab of your personal page whenever a friend posts a selfie. New outfits, cars,
houses etc can all be shown off.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Messages to friends look like texts ->
Also non-essential, yet an immersive feature that could be added to the game to make it seem like you are actually part of
the world. Perhaps even an animation of your character bringing up their phone when you open your messages would be a nice
little feature.

 3. (3)[Unconfirmed] Letting you message in a raid and/Or showing friend status (IN RAID) ->
With all buttons locked whenever you are in combat or raiding, you are unable to properly read and respond to messages. I
don't see why not, however your message menu should not pause the game, giving you an unfair advantage mid raid. A Raid
symbol next to your friends name would let you know they are busy and might take a while to respond. No response as of yet
from the dev team.

 4. (3)[Unconfirmed] Larger friends list ->
(see above in rework section)

 5. (4)[Unconfirmed] Biography(Background story) ->
Just a small feature to be added to someones profile that will help immerse the player into the world of TW. Good for rp and just having fun in TW, can't really see any downside from it. No response yet.

- *Hobbies and Favors:*
- 

- *Store and Events:*
- 

 1. (5)[Semi-Confirmed] Holiday or event themed items ->
Items, events and objects that represent specific events that will temporarily be available for purchase. From small things, like buying mistletoe for your safehouse, or something big like an outfit to dress up as winston or wei for halloween. This will help keep things fresh, without breaking the lore of TW and bringing in a decent profit for the devs to fund the game. No confirmation of any specific item yet.

- *Coop and other Player interaction:*
- 

 1. (1)[Confirmed] Coop Raids ->
Raiding people with a friend, what not to love? Probably the 1. most requested feature in TW, and the devs have granted our
wish. This is confirmed, and in the works. Details of what will change in the coop, how favors will function and if it will
influence rewards are not yet revealed. Sit tight for more info.
- *Map and Zones:*
- 

- *Bug Fixes:*
- 

 1. (1)[Unconfirmed] Add a respawn option with no penalty ->
You may respawn from the menu (whilst still alive) with no penalty of face loss, however it will put your raid on a cooldown
if you were in one. Just a nice fix to getting stuck, or any bugs showing up in the current beta (unnaccessible rackets etc)
No words from the devs yet.

- *Triad and NPCS:*
- 

1. (5)[Unconfirmed] Animation fixes for NPCS (most are great) ->
Kissing animation is needed, as npcs will rub their faces together (lol). Perhaps a few more facial expressions, laughing
etc. Other than that I haven't found any animations that need fixes yet.
- *Social Interaction and Romances:*
- 

- *Missions and Gamemodes (Raid included):*
- 

- *Community Input:*
- 

 1. (3)[Unconfirmed] Creation Kit ->
A kit created by the devs that contains simple -> intricate pattners, lines and color selection etc, that will allow players
to create their own clothing, (on top of a plain existing model of clothing of course, like v-necks) tattoos, shoes,
accesories (custom mask etc), decals for cars, emblems for gang. The original of the item must be owned first (buying plain
version of clothing in shop) This will allow players to have one of a kind patterns that no one else has, giving each player
the opportunity to feel unique and make a name for themselves. I am sure the community would be fine with the devs selling
this kit as a pack, as long as it is a reasonable price $10-$20. If you need reference material, APB reloaded's pattern maker
is a good comparison.

 2. (4)[Unconfirmed] Community Made Items ->
Simply put, Items you can find now in the vehicles tab and clothing, hair, weapons etc, some of these will be made by the
community. Rather than having thousands of items pouring in, the community will make a pol, voting their favourite 5-10 items
of the week/month/whatever period of time via screenshots on the forum, and they will added to the game. To prevent legal
issues, they will either only be available by in game cash (not gold), with official TW items being sold in gold, or TW devs
will take a 50% tax (or whatever is agreed) from the item (100 gold hair, 50 goes back to devs, 50 to player). There are many
examples of this model being extremely profitable and encouraging creativity in the community, as seen in CS:GO where
majority of the guns you buy in cases, are community made, or SecondLife, where 99% of the content is community made.
